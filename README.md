For this project I have followed Page Obeject Model Approach with BDD using Cucumber, Selenium, Java with Junit framework. Download the project from GitHub and save it on local. To run this in any IDE(IntelliJ/Eclipse) open this project as Maven Project. I have defined all the source code in Buggy/SRC/Test in 'Com.Package.Buggy'. As i have used POM approach, defined all page level variables in 'Page class', Senarios in 'Buggy.feature' under Buggy/resources, Steps bindings in 'Buggy/test/src/com.package.Stepdefinitions/Stepdefinitions'. Defined the common methods in Utils.class copied Chromedriver in Resouces. Created runner class, which we can intiate run and we can customize the runner class as per our requirement to run specific test cases using 'Tags'. By end of each test scenario, Cucumber after class will check if any test scenario failed, and will attach a screenshot if sceanrio failed. End of each run Cucumber will generate a Html report in directory->cucmber-html-reports->index.html, which can be viewed in browser. Chrome browser should be available.
